##  Testing 
Testing was carried out by creating each function at a time to minimise the small errors impacting the whole project.

### Here are some of the challenges I encountered and steps taken to fix.

1. Validating user input for category choises.
  try/except method is used to validate the user input for category choise however, it was throwing system error instead of preset printing messagge
